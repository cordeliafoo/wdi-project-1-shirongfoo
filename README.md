Stop being a small fish in a big pond!  Move around the screen to eat smaller fish and watch yourself grow.  Beware of the bigger fish.  They'll gobble you up.

## Gameplay
Use the mouse to move your fish around the screen.
Hover over other small fish to eat them.
Collect enough points to size up!

## Development
* HTML 5 Canvas, programmed using Javascript
* Some Responsive Web Design so the canvas re-centers and font adjusts accordingly when browser size changes
* index.html/style.css/script.js
* [View Code Workflow here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FrsXMXGYfDkEYv3vO1CTZoAoVhwKTT2MSuzlULNjtQA/edit#slide=id.g2029f574bc_0_298)

## What I Would Have Done Differently
* Increase game speed as score increases
* Fix the mouse position in canvas when browser resizes
* Use key presses instead of mouse to control my fish so multiple players can play simultaneously
